# Cpp DSA
Repo contains some most common Data Structure and Algorithm in cpp. Which will useful in future application of Competitive Programming as well Interview Preparation.


 Hi :wave:
Fellas,

The Data Structure is the :heart: of Computer Science and Algorithms are the step and procedure to operate on these Data Structure.
Some Most Comman Data Structure are like Array, Queue, Stack, Tree, Hash, Heap etc. Mastering these Data Structure will help you to solve many problems while you are doing competitive Programming or sitting for the Tech Interview. 


However If You think that you have some great Resources and you love to contribute you can directly create a Pull Request. So Every PR must be check and pass test, and successful debug.

 ## Pull Request Instructions
 
 * Instead of Creating a new Branch. Fork the Repo and Update Your contribution to the related files or Repo.
 * Try to add the Algorithm or Program in files respectively.
 * You can add new content only **Related to C++ Programming** 
 * Create a PR with subjective Title. This will help me to organize the content in better way.
 * Try to Update the `.gitignore` if you're adding different formats of content.
 * Create a PR :bowtie:
