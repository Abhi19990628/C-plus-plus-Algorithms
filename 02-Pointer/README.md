## Pointer(*) Basics 


  > #### Pointer is the most confusing topic in Functional and Structural Programming.Why not it's one of most generic interview Topic as well as choosen topic for every Programmer.I believe after Reading this, your all doubts related to Pointer will be cleared.
  

## *Pointer Definition*

#### Let's declare a Variable 
```cpp
 int main(){
    int a=5;  //It eats up some memory in your RAM. Cause you've declared a variable.
    }
```   

Since each statement we declare in our program eats up some memory and in RAM the memory is divided into some random block which is called **Memory block**.So the variable `a=5` has taken `4 bytes` of Memory in the RAM memory Block.These Memory Block have some addresses What if we are interested in knowing that address?
